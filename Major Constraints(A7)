1. Economic costs: Can be restrained by a pricy software, also can be constrained by an imbalance in ingredient list
2. Time: Due to some work I need to get caught up on, some assignments may take time for me to do successful completion
3. Scope: One of my team members agree that this project will be hard enough to put in a considerable amount of time on, but easy enough to not overwhelm me or get into specifics that I don't know about
4. Professional/Technical Expertise: It will require my expertise on computer programming and AI development in order to get completed. I may require more time for me to finish the whole project due to my lack of practice with this type of program
  and may require me to get more group members involved.
5. Ethical/Legal: It will help restaurants specifically keep track of their ingredients and detail when they need to order more. No copyrighted characters or music are involved,
  so no legal disputes are involved.
6. Security: Could result in the txt file being hacked by hackers to offset the amount of ingredients remaining
7. Social: This is an app primarily used by restaurants by staff members, not much for public use. It will benefit lives by helping keep track of restaurant supplies.
8. Environmental: As far as I'm aware, all environmental issues that phone apps usually contain will also apply to the project due to also being a phone app. It will also exclusively
  be used in restaurants.
9. Diversity and Cultural: It could be used in restaurants that sell foreign food if that accounts for anything.
