## Abstract
The main purpose of InventoryIntel is to save restaurants’ profits and reduce waste. The way we seek to accomplish this with this project is with specialized scanners and sensors along with a mobile app interface to connect with the hardware. The hardware components collect the current weights of dry stock(flour, yeast, sugar…) and records usage by scanning order tickets as they are printed in the kitchen. The hardware sends data back to our app in the form of .txt files sent over the LAN. Using all this critical data, InventoryIntel can give a restaurant owner a overall look at their inventory at any given time right in the palm of their hand.
