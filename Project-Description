Discription: For this project we will develop a pice of hardware that affixes to existing ticket printers (prints orders as they come in) 
in resurants that will read order tickets as they come in. Using this data and software that uses AI to account for unexpected loss, we seek
create a product that can easily and automaticly manage a resturant's inventory as well as provide the owner a snapshot of their usages and
other usefull data for running the business. Our product will be able to run autonamosly and order new product as needed from the resturant's
suppliers.
