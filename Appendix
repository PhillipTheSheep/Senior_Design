Work Thus Far (Please note: we started our project somewhat late because we were having trouble forming a group and it has been difficult 
                finding time to colaborate as Ben works nearly full time and it has been difficult in general not being able to interface 
                in person to get work done on this project)

Ben
1. Came up with project initial idea and design
2. Worked on coming up with a design that would work for most resturants
3. Spoke with business owners (i.e. my boss at Two Cities Pizza Co. Mason, OH) to assess what would make for a good product
4. General research and development including deciding which components we need to purchase and where we will be able to 
    3d print some necessary parts
